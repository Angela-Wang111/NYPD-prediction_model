    "# Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "  Our prediction problem is to classify whether each alleged incident is confirmed (substantiated or exonerated) by board or not (unsubstantiated) based on selected columns. It is a classification problem. We picked our target variable to be the board disposition because we think it is the most important column and it is the outcome of the entire dataframe. Also, we think that a lot of other features probably contribute to help predict this final result. We decided to use F1 score as our evaluation metric because it is a metric taking both the true positive rate and precision into consideration. If the true positive rate is too low, it would be unfair for the complainant and if the precision is too low, it would also be unfair for the officer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Model\n",
    "In our baseline model, we used a Logistic Regression Model with 15 features, 2 of which are quantitative, 4 are ordinal, and 9 are nominal. We dropped some columns that are deemed not contributing to the final outcome or not obtainable at the time of prediction, some of which include \"unique_mos_id\", \"rank_abbrev_now\", \"rank_now\", and \"complaint_id\". We think \"rank_abbrev_now\", \"rank_now\", \"command_now\" columns will not be available at the time of prediction, and columns like \"outcome_description\", \"unique_mos_id\", \"first_name\", \"last_name\", \"complaint_id\", \"shield_no\" are not very helpful. \"rank_incident\" already has a similar column \"rank_abbrev_incident\". The \"precinct\" column is also dropped because it is not directly related to the allegation outcome, and it is recorded as numbers in the original dataframe, and easily treated by the model as quantitative even though it is nominal. The mean F1 score from the baseline model is about 0.71-0.73 depending on the train-test split, which is not bad but can definitely be improved, since the best score for F1 score is 1 and the worst is 0. We have not done much feature engineering on the original table, thus the F1 score still has the potential to be higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Model\n",
    "Firstly, we changed our classifier from Logistic Regression to K-Neighbors Classifier and Random Forest Classifier to see if there are any improvements. After checking the mean F1 score of these two new classifiers and comparing them with the mean F1 score of the base line model (Logistic Regression), we decided to use Random Forest Classifier, which has the highest F1 score, as our final classifier.\n",
    "Secondly, we added two new features to the data set. The first one is whether the officer and the complainant have the same ethnicity. The reason why we include this feature is that we think the board might take the racial problem into consideration when giving the final desposition. The other feature is the duration of the case calculated by the year/month received and year/month closed. We think that for non-confirmed case (Unsubstantiated), the board might take longer time to investigate to make this despotion. The EDA on these two features also shows that there is a difference in mean between the two categories.\n",
    "The final effort on choosing the final model is that we use Grid Search Cross-validation to decide the best max_depth for the Random Forest Classifer. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Fairness Evaluation\n",
    "For the fairness evaluation, we want to evaluate the fairness based on the ethnicity of the officers. For simplicity, we binarize the ethnicity into White and Non-white. The prediction and the evaluation is done with only the test set.\n",
    "When doing this fairness evaluation, we would use precision as the metric. The reason is that if the precision (proportion of correct positive identification) is too low for one ethnicity group, there would be many false positive cases and significantly affects the reputation of the officer. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the permutation test: \n",
    "- Null Hypothesis: the precision socre for white officers and non-white officers are the same\n",
    "- Alternative Hypothesis: the precision socre for white officers and non-white officers are not the same\n",
    "\n",
    "Our p-value from the permutation test is 0.53. Since the p-value is larger than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. The result of this fairness evaluation is that our model is fair for both the white officers and non-white officers in terms of precision score. We also used confusion matrix to confirm our result."
